# Goal
This project is used to learn about some technologies.
 * Current used: VueJS, Google Maps API, Some thing like BEM to organize CSS..

# How-to
It is possible to use just to view points or create routes. But the main goal here is to allow create route with the bus stops.
To do it you need to get the information of all stops on the Bus company site (At some point in future it will be automatic.).
 - Using BHTrans web page:
    - Access the BHTRans's site and find the 'Itiner√°rio service' [lINK](http://servicosbhtrans.pbh.gov.br/bhtrans/e-servicos/e-servicos.asp?servico=S02&opcao=ITINER%C3%81RIO%20DE%20%C3%94NIBUS)
    - Find the bus-line/number and select it.
    - Chose the origin-destiny
    - Copy the table
    - Paste on webmap-route's capture textbox
    - Click on capture.
    - Then you are ready to create the route on map by clicking on Set Route.
